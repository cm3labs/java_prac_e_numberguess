# java_prac_e_numberguess
Me attempting to learn java, program one, a number generator



2024-08-23 : made working app, started GitHub repo

**current features:**  
    - takes your number  
    - picks a number between 1-10  
    - let's you keep guessing till you find it

**Need to implement:**  
    - lets you define upper and lower range  
    - does NOT let you use numbers outside the range  
    - different responses  
    - "unreliable" responses: responses that may change (and/or possibly, frustratingly so, deliver innaccurate feedback)  

**CHANGELOG**  
2024-0824 : I made a big mess. Killed local copy and started over from last commit, clearned up README.md a bit. Starting from working simple version of game, working on features one at a time.
