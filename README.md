# java_prac_e_numberguess
Me attempting to learn java, program one, a number generator

2024-08-23 : made working app, started GitHub repo

current features:
    - takes your number
    - picks a number between 1-10
    - let's you keep guessing till you find it

Need to implement:
    - lets you define upper and lower range
    - does NOT let you use numbers outside the range
    - different responses
    - "unreliable" responses: responses that may change (and/or possibly, frustratingly so, deliver innaccurate feedback)
